# responsive-brighton-times
This is a revamp of The Brighton Times page from the udacity course Responsive Web Design fundamentals. This page has been completely made responsive by the use of flexbox and media queries. Combined mostly fluid pattern, layout shifter pattern and off-canvas pattern to achieve the final responsive page.
